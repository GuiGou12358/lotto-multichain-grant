# Retro Funding for Lotto Multichain dApp

## Proposal Summary

This proposal seeks retrospectively funding for the development of Lotto multichain dApp.

This proposal will be presented to the DAO after the deployment of Lotto Multichain dApp and only if the dApp is a success (functional dApp, positive user feedback, large number of participations) based on some KPI defined previously with the community.

The funding request will cover retroactive compensation for completed work and will also allow the team to continue more serenely to evolve and improve the dApp.

### Market Opportunity

The traditional lottery market sees millions of weekly players in Web2. Blockchain technology provides the perfect foundation for a transparent, verifiable, and truly fair lottery system. Our dApp bridges this gap between traditional lottery systems and Web3 capabilities.

The Lotto multichain dApp has the potential to:

- Drive significant adoption of the Polkadot ecosystem
- Demonstrate real-world utility of blockchain technology
- Create a new paradigm for decentralized gaming applications

We appreciate your consideration of this proposal and welcome any feedback from the community.
